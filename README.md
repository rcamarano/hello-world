Back to basics

Hi everyone, I'm here to learn about code and software development. Starting form scratch...
Any help you can give me is more than welcome. I'm 45 years old, from where an old guy like me should start?

My professional experience is most with marketing and advertising agencies. 
Nowadays I'm learning more about the digital market and I'd love to learn how to code. Specially HTML 5, JS, PHP and Phyton.

So, here I am. 
Let's do it.

I thank all of you in advance
Cheers!
